### Capstone Project IV: Data Visualisation
Conduct an exploratory study of the current state of renewable energy and assess the progress towards a complete transition away from fossil fuels.

### Capstone Project V: Databases
Create a program that use SQLite for a bookstore that allows them to add new books, update book information, delete books, and search for specific books. 

### Capstone Project VI: Image Processing
Optimize and calibrate the parameters of a Random Forest Classifier model on the MNIST dataset, Identify the classes that the model has difficulty classifying, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

### Capstone Project VII: Unsupervised Machine Learning
Conduct an in-depth analysis of the UsArrests.csv dataset using Principal Component Analysis, including pre-processing steps and interpretation of outcomes. Additionally, perform clustering analysis using two different techniques, examining the resulting clusters and identifying any shared characteristics among them.
