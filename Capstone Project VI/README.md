### Capstone Project VI: Image Processing

Optimize and calibrate the parameters of a Random Forest Classifier model on the MNIST dataset, Identify the classes that the model has difficulty classifying, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

### Usage

The project is accessible in the "Capstone Project VI.ipynb" file, which can be opened using Jupyter Notebook. To run the Jupyter Notebook, the following Python libraries must be installed: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. The necessary dataset files must be placed in the same directory as the notebook, these are: t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz, t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz, train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz, train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
