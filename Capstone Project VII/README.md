### Capstone Project VII: Unsupervised Machine Learning

Conduct an in-depth analysis of the UsArrests.csv dataset using Principal Component Analysis, including pre-processing steps and interpretation of outcomes. Additionally, perform clustering analysis using two different techniques, examining the resulting clusters and identifying any shared characteristics among them.

### Usage

The project is accessible in the "Capstone Project VII.ipynb" file, which can be opened using Jupyter Notebook. To run the Jupyter Notebook, the following Python libraries must be installed: scikit-learn, ppca, scipy, andas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. The necessary dataset file USArrests.csv must be placed in the same directory as the notebook.
